## Poems

### Poem 1: GPT-5
*Model: `openai/gpt-5`*

Out of the firth it lifts,
a red grammar of load and trust,
triangles deciding the sky,
each joint a small oath driven home
with the hammer’s iron syllable.

The water moves without memory,
but the bridge remembers for it:
salt on its tongue, gulls stitched
to its flanks like loose commas,
the long breath of haar
blurring the margins of Queensferry.

Men once climbed its ribs,
lanterns swinging, black as script
against vermilion bone,
their knuckles learning wind,
their boots tasting frost on Inchgarvie,
each rivet a star they pinned
to keep the night from sinking.

They say it was always being painted,
endless as tide—an old, bright rumor.
Even rumor needs a surface to cling to,
and here is acreage enough:
a skin that drinks the weather,
hardens to a hymn, then weathers again.

Trains pass with their portable mornings,
their evening luggage of faces.
Through the cantilevered throat
the click and hush, click and hush,
a pulse laid down between coasts,
flesh across the mile-wide silence.

Beside it newer lines have been strung—
strings of road and harp of cable—
but nothing answers wind like this,
this wrought-iron throat
singing forward into the century,
its red echo set against rain.

Stand on the shore and count
what cannot be counted:
angles upon angles,
the patience of steel,
the way a bridge breaks a river
only to teach it how to hold a sky.

You can feel it in your chest,
that sure inheritance—
how weight can be persuaded,
how distance can be taught to close,
how a span becomes a sentence
and the land, at last, replies.

### Poem 2: GPT-4.1
*Model: `openai/gpt-4.1`*

Rising red against the mist and tide,  
Iron sinews arch across the Forth,  
A latticework of purpose, wide  
And steadfast, echoing the North.  

Engines sing upon its bones,  
Steel rivets pulse with human dreams,  
Salt winds etch the old and known  
Into geometry that gleams.  

Dawn paints rust with molten gold,  
Each span a promise, bold and clear,  
Carrying voices, stories told  
Of makers, workers, travelers, near.  

Beneath: the water’s ancient flow—  
Above: the bridge’s endless flight—  
History joined in ebb and glow,  
A monument to craft and might.

### Poem 3: GPT-4o Mini
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`*

In twilight's glow, a giant stands,  
Of iron lace and crafted hands,  
A testament to dreams once dreamed,  
Where river's pulse in steel is schemed.  

With arches bold, it spans the tide,  
A crimson crown where eagles glide,  
Each rivet tells a tale of toil,  
Of engineers and earthbound soil.  

Through storm and sun, it holds its grace,  
A silhouette in time and space,  
Linked shores where whispers drift like sails,  
In harmony, where history prevails.  

The trains that rumble, the ships that pass,  
All bow to this majestic mass,  
A bridge of hope, of love, of pride,  
Eternal symbol, standing wide.  

As shadows lengthen and stars ignite,  
In silent awe, we share the night,  
For in its presence, hearts are stirred,  
In every glance, a dream deferred.

### Poem 4: Llama 3.1 8B
*Model: `meta/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`*

Pillars of steel, against the grey
Mood swings of sea and struggling sky
Built for the brave, the road ahead
Quests to the north, across the Forth's wide bay

A meeting of art and industrial past
Fractured rhythms, where latticeworks last
Golden hours come to spotlight the span
A message that greed has a wondrous stand

Gritty horizons fade as sea meets sound
As sailors integrating labor all around
Their jaws were set when steel men set to wander
Setting into vision striding bays of Fife's thunder

Expanse has built meager given understand 
Many stating faith in an age's better plan
Endless current Made it a humble emblem to forge
Unstraught existence where designs make piercing love

### Poem 5: Llama 3.3 70B
*Model: `meta/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`*

Over the Firth of Forth's dark tide,
A giant's fist, a lattice pride,
The bridge stands tall, a feat of might,
A symphony of steel, a wondrous sight.

Its cantilevers stretch, a majestic span,
A sweep of genius, born of human plan,
The trains rumble on, a steady beat,
As the bridge's grandeur meets the eye's repeat.

The Scottish skies, a somber hue,
Reflect the mood, of this industrial clue,
The bridge's paint, a deep, rich red,
A symbol of strength, that's stood the test of time and dread.

The waters below, a swirling storm,
The bridge's pillars, a steadfast form,
A testament to engineers of old,
A marvel of the age, a story to be told.

The sun sets low, over the Forth's dark shore,
The bridge's latticework, a fiery glow once more,
A beacon of progress, in a bygone age,
The Forth Bridge stands, a monumental stage.

### Poem 6: GPT-4o
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o`*

Beneath the sky, in shifting hues,  
A solemn arc in ruddy fuse,  
The Forth Bridge stands, a titan’s thread,  
A woven path where dreams are bred.  

Its ribs of steel, in rust-fire glow,  
Span waters deep where whispers flow;  
The firth beneath, a mirror wide,  
Reflects the toil of human pride.  

Through hammer’s clang and furnace roar,  
It rose to bind each distant shore,  
A bridge of hope, a crafted spire,  
Born from grit and hearts afire.  

The winds may howl, the tides may race,  
But steadfast stands its ageless face,  
A monument to time and dream,  
Above the silent currents’ gleam.  

Oh, Forth’s great child, your spine of flame  
Bears stories long as mortal name;  
Through mist and storm, through dusk and sun,  
Your watch endures, your work undone.

### Poem 7: Cohere Command R+
*Model: `Cohere-command-r-plus-08-2024`*

Mighty steel, a marvel of design,
Stretching across the waters, a sight so fine.
Two cities linked, a journey's swift delight,
Forth Bridge, a Scottish wonder, a rail-borne flight.

With grace, it stands, a testament to man,
A feat of engineering, a grand plan.
Three towers, like giants, reaching for the sky,
Reflecting in the river, a mirror's lie.

The trains rush by, a constant flow,
A modern marvel, yet a century ago.
A symbol of progress, a nation's pride,
Where rails and river meet, a bridge's stride.

In sun's warm glow or winter's icy breath,
It stands resilient, defying nature's wrath.
A beacon, a landmark, a sight to behold,
A tale of travel, a story to unfold.

Oh, Forth Bridge, a masterpiece of art,
Where iron and water merge, a timeless heart.
