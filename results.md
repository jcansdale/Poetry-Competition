### Poem 2: GPT-4.1
*Model: `openai/gpt-4.1`*

Upon the Forth, a lattice red and bold  
Suspends the steel-lit dreams of men and time.  
Its arches bend where brimming winds unfold  
And trains rush forth to lands beyond the clime.  

Each rivet pressed by hands both skilled and worn  
Still sings through dusk and haze of rolling tide;  
A testament to labor, sweat, and dawn—  
The bridge stands proud where waters slow and wide.  

Beneath its shadow, ships and shadows pass,  
While seabirds wheel between the girders' sweep.  
The river's mirror shimmers, glass on brass,  
Reflecting hopes the bridge was built to keep.  

Enduring through the storm and salt and years,  
It binds the shore, the future, and past fears.

### Poem 3: GPT-4o Mini
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`*

Upon the Forth, where waters dance and flow,  
A marvel wrought from steel and dreams so high,  
With every beam and arch, its might does show,  
An emblem bold beneath the vast, blue sky.  

Brave engineers did sketch its grand design,  
A symphony of strength, a tale of grace,  
It curves with elegance, a lifeline fine,  
Connecting shores, a testament in place.  

In tempest's roar or sunlight's warm embrace,  
It stands unwavering, a sentinel true,  
As trains do rush, and vessels find their pace,  
The bridge reflects the heart of all that's due.  

O Forth Bridge, steadfast 'gainst the turning tide,  
In you, the spirit of a nation bides.

### Poem 4: Llama 3.1 8B
*Model: `meta/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`*

Amidst the Firth's darkening, evening tide
The Forth Bridge stands, a steel giant proud
Its silvery form, against the sky divide
Reflecting sunsets, with a beauty avowed

Its chains of steel, like giant's arms outstretched
Support the rail, a path above the deep
The waves below, in troubled motion sketched
As ferry boats pass, with gentle, rolling creep

The bridge's grandeur, stirs a poet's heart
To sing ofScotland's beauty, in its art
A symbol of progress, through the ages strong
Yet, tied to heritage, where loyalties belong

And though it stands, a testament to man's might
It charms with wonder, in the Firth's pale light.

### Poem 5: Llama 3.3 70B
*Model: `meta/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`*

Amidst the Firth of Forth's majestic sweep,
A mighty titan spans the waters wide,
The Forth Bridge stands, its iron latticework deep,
A marvel of the Victorian tide.

Its cantilevered arms, a sturdy frame,
Support the railway's winding, serpent course,
As trains, like steel serpents, speed and claim
Their passage, borne on girders' mighty force.

The bridge's rust-red hue, like sunset's glow,
Illumes the estuary's darkening shore,
As sea and sky converge, the scene to know,
A symphony of steel, and waves, and more.

And when the sun dips low, and daylight fades,
The Forth Bridge stands, a sentinel of shades.

### Poem 6: GPT-4o
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o`*

Beneath the sky where restless tides do play,  
A marvel born of steel and human might,  
The Forth Bridge spans the waves in grand display,  
Its girders gleam beneath both day and night.  

With countless rivets binding strength untold,  
It arches proud, defying time's decay,  
A sentinel through tempests fierce and cold,  
Enduring years as summers fade to gray.  

Its shadow dances on the silver tide,  
Where seabirds wheel and call into the breeze,  
A monument to dreams long fortified,  
Its beauty sings to those who cross with ease.  

The Forth Bridge stands, eternal in its grace,  
A timeless thread in Scotland's vast embrace.

### Poem 7: Cohere Command R+
*Model: `Cohere-command-r-plus-08-2024`*

O'er the Firth of Forth, a marvel stands,
A bridge, a vision, by human hands,
Three mighty towers, a feat of steel and grace,
Where trains now fly, a marvel to embrace.

Its cables sing, a symphony of might,
A structure so grand, a wondrous sight,
In sun's warm glow or fog's mysterious veil,
A symbol of strength, that never will fail.

Across the waters, a journey's swift pace,
A testament to engineering's grace,
Connecting shores, a pathway to new lands,
A timeless wonder, the Forth Bridge stands.

Forever a landmark, its beauty endures,
A Scottish icon, forever secure.
