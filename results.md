### Poem 1: GPT-5
*Model: `openai/gpt-5`*

Ash the Russian Dwarf, a pocket-sized flash,
Zooms through the bedding in a crumb-crunch dash;
Whiskers like commas, he pauses at his stash,
Stuffs eight sunflower stars in a cheeky cache,
Then moonwalks his wheel with squeaks and panache.

### Poem 2: GPT-4.1
*Model: `openai/gpt-4.1`*

Ash, the tiny fluff-ball darting fast,  
Whiskers twitch with schemes unsurpassed.  
He stuffs his cheeks till they balloon wide,  
Then hides in your sleeve, where secrets reside.  
Spinning his wheel, he dreams of fame—  
Oh, mighty Ash, in his hamster hall of game!

### Poem 3: GPT-4o Mini
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`*

In a cozy little cage, Ash does prance,  
With tiny feet and a wiggly dance,  
He burrows through bedding, a fluffy parade,  
In a world made of tunnels, his grand escapade.  
A sunflower seed, his treasure so bright,  
This dwarf-sized dynamo brings pure delight!

### Poem 4: Llama 3.1 8B
*Model: `meta/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`*

Ash the hamster, spinning round,
In her wheel, a blur is found.
Her pink nose twitches with glee,
Chasing dust bunnies wild and free.
She burrows deep, a tiny queen,
In her secret world, her heart is seen.

### Poem 5: Llama 3.3 70B
*Model: `meta/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`*

Ash the hamster, furry and bright,
Spins on his wheel with joyful delight.
His whiskers twitch, his ears flail with glee,
As he burrows deep in his cozy spree.
With a twinkle in his eye, he plays all night,
Stealing hearts with his silly, furry light.

### Poem 6: GPT-4o
*Model: `openai/gpt-4o`*

Ash the hamster, small and spry,  
Zooms in circles—don't know why!  
Tiny toes on turbo speed,  
A wheel-bound blur, a fluffball steed.  
Cheek pouches stuffed, a snack buffet,  
Ash, the whirlwind of the day!

### Poem 7: Cohere Command R+
*Model: `Cohere-command-r-plus-08-2024`*

Ash the hamster, a tiny ball of fur,
Whizzes by with a blur, a blur of energy,
In his wheel, he's a spinning blur,
A blur of whiskers, a blur so cute,
His little paws, a blur of speed,
Racing through dreams, a blur of fun.
